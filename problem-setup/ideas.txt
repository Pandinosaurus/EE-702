# Initial Ideas

* Fast moving car number detection from multi-modal video
* Textbook scan from page-flipping video without additional h/w.
* Velocity of moving body in single image from deblurring and depth estimate.
* Deforestation and soil erosion site detection using time-series satellite imaging.
* 3D model reconstruction of iconic sites using large data (tourist photos)
* Video genre classification.
* Video completion using depth map and trajectory estimation guidance.
